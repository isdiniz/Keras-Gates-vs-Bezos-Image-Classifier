>>> import keras

```

You'll need firefox along with selenium webdriver to get this working. Again, use Conda as a package manager and it should be OK, at least on Mac :/

# Stuff we're working on

- First Video: downloaing the images, getting a convnet working from scratch with around 75% validation accuracy
- Second Video: using a pretrained feature extractor VGG16 to genreate better features, which we'll feed into a MLP (not a conv network)
- Third Video: forthcoming!
